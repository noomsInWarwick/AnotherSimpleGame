### General Information

This project is my first endeavor into developing and deploying an Android application written in Kotlin.  It is version 1.0 and is the starting point for what should be a fun and learning experience for all involved.

### Screenshots

### Technologies

This application is written in native Kotlin and makes use of no external libraries, api's, or databases.  The application is self contained and does not interact with any services or calls over the internet.

### Inspiration

Yes there is inspiration behind this project.  While at a playground with 2 of my young
grandchildren in Central Florida a young girl joined us at the swingsets and helped push
my grand-daughter on the swing.  She pointed over to an area of tall grass a short distance
from the palyground and told us we should not go over there because that is where the piggy
snake and vampire snake live.  Very sweet and duly noted.

The next day while drawing animal figures with my grandchildren, piggy snake came up in our
conversation and the very first drawing of Piggy Snake was made.

Now what?  Actually nothing for a couple of months until I needed something to use as my first
Kotlin and Android app project.  A simple game geared towards the younger generation focused on
Piggy Snake was an ideal starter for me and here it is a few months (and then some) later.
